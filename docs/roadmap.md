# Roadmap

- Set marker dynamically by functions from the library
- Allow for the syntax format.* to be used always even tho they are not defined
  e.g. the definition is domain:resource:option.[args]
- add NIL Token to lexer and parser
- explain command should also work fro config options
- Infos sollten alle Doc string beinhalten ohne marker (wahscheinlich notwendig,
  dass wir pos tracken in den Tokens).
- replacing targets witha fcuntion which is returning if the target is correct.
- how to handle required optoins?
