# Roadmap

1. Allow for custom marker definitions in the parser and lexer.
2. LocalLoader + HTTPLoader etc. (loader docs in general).
3. Make the loader much easier by just using the high level variables but more
   methods in the interface so the interaction is easier.
4. Variablen fÃ¼r marker (custom)
5. wildcards for typeid?
6. sdk package for save public usage
7. Build a variable in which the marker themselves will be included so
   referenceing other marker values is possible in the future e.g.
   path:to:i=32 -> $path:to:i resolves to 32.
8. Namespaces for typeid? e.g. builtin.string/default.string
   default.slice.ptr.int etc. On first hrought it isnt much of a great idea
9. Maybe have cudedicated Byte and Rune Tokens?
10. Querys on typeid e.g. slice.*.int
11. multiline strings
12. one defiitionf or multiple targets
13. tokens pkg und Token umbennen zu Expr?
