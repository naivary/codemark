# Roadmap

1. Allow for custom marker definitions in the parser and lexer.
2. LocalLoader + HTTPLoader etc. (loader docs in general).
3. Make the loader much easier by just using the high level variables but more
   methods in the interface so the interaction is easier.
4. Variablen für marker.
5. wildcards for typeid?
6. sdk package for save public usage
