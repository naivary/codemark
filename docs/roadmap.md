# Roadmap

4. Variablen fÃ¼r marker (custom): Build a variable map in which the marker themselves will be included so
   referenceing other marker values is possible in the future e.g.
   path:to:i=32 -> $path:to:i resolves to 32.
11. multiline strings!!
12. map converter
13. Time converter
3. Dynamic errors for comparison
