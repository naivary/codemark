# Roadmap

- Set marker dynamically by functions from the library
- Allow for the syntax format.* to be used always even tho they are not defined
  e.g. the definition is domain:resource:option.[args]
- outputer interface for different writing options (can it just be a io.Writer?)
- options has to be a custom Options type with different methods like filter,
  Get, Exists etc.
- add NIL Token to lexer and parser
